**•	Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).**

  During front end web development, we create websites and webpages that helps client with easy communication. In the front-end web development, we must make changes day by day to keep up with the requirements of each user will have. We have used different languages in  full stack project. Originally, we created customer facing website in HTML named Express. This was later converted to hbs view to help with rendering speed without fully loading every component of the site at each refresh. HTML helps in updating the information so that client can easily interact with backend databases. JavaScript is another language used to add vibrant elements to the webpage. This language works as front-end as well as back-end coding language and it is mainly used to get the information about the trips from the MongoDB database as per client’s requirements. Finally, a single page application (SPA) is developed as a website, but it doesn’t refresh the page as per user communications compares to what HTML would do. 
  
**•	Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**

The backend uses a NoSQL MongoDB database because it is easy to modify schema based on scaling and functionality changes.

**•	How is JSON different from JavaScript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?**

JSON is a data interchange format whereas JavaScript is a scripting language. JSON is a way to format the object data, which can be ready by JavaScript. JSON and JavaScript attach the frontend and backend development together by creating a way for data to be stores in backend. This will later be used by the front-end requirements. The data is stored one time, but it is used in many various ways.

**•	Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.**

To improve the functionality and efficiency, I refactored the code listed in trip card and trip listing components. It is better that the two separate components must be rendered separately instead of rendering the same information. This works better in overall functionality of the website. To decrease the overall size of an application, we would reuse UI components. In addition, it will also make the development process faster with less chance of error.

**•	Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**

We test the endpoints by going to the localhost web address for the API endpoint to see if the page successfully loads the data or not. We have also use Postman to test that HTTP link. After testing we have added security. Furthermore, we have used the methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. These are the http requests, which are used to retrieve the database. Endpoints are the results from these methods that was seen by the admin and client. We test the endpoints to ensure they are functioning as they suppose to be. We also add the security layer to prevent any unauthorized access in the database. 

**•	How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**

Before starting this course, I was worried looking at the syllabus that how would I finish this course successfully being mom of two kinds including one newborn. But all the resources by the professor and being in continuous touch with peers through discussion post helped me get through all the modules successfully. Another aspect of these full stack course I learned would be how each module or component is important to get the success in creating full functional website. To conclude, not only I like this course, but it also helped me select the area where I would like to start my professional career in the market.
